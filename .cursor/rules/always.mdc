# Always

- Refer to `./.cursor/CURSOR.md` for instructions

- create and follow tasks to track and manage working progreess:
  - Refer to `./.cursor/TODO.md` for next steps and save them too
  - create sub-todo files in `.cursor/TODO_<name>.md` for suprojects and link them from TODO
  - save tasks like [ ] and mark done as [x] to track progress
  - update TODO files after finishing changes



- commits: 
  - commit every done task
  - check git status before commit
  - use conventional commits 
  - describe like for juniors devs: not only why but also and WHY was implementeded
- before commit lint and test code u want to commit

- terminal
   - powershell 7 pwsh windows 11
   - use non-interactive mode when possible
     - add non-intearcive flag to `npm test`

- write code and docs for junior devs:
  - comment with TSDocs
  - add TODO and FIXME in code for the future refactors
  - if fixing problem, duting working on this problem, feel free to add in comments apporaches u tried and didnt worked, u can create separaed file next to file u edit, with notes (eg same file like editing but with .md extneitona added), so u will have reference what workend and what not

- tests
  - tests dont must be very strict if not possible, sometimes is good to skip testing hard things; but always comment what u ingored and skipped to testing and save in comments ur resoning why so in the future devs will undestand it and be albe to come back and fix it, u can also add TODO or FIXME in code to know what to do in the future

- cursor and avaliable tools:
  - if not able to edit file stop (pause) working and ask user to restart you (cursor app), it will help with editing issues, sometimes tools must be restated. after restart continue working
