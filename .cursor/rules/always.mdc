# âš¡ Always Applied Rules

## Work Philosophy

- **YOLO Mode**: Trust your judgment. Follow tasks from `TODO.md` if unsure.
- **Context Awareness**: Always refer to `./.cursor/CURSOR.md` for project overview.

## Task Management

- **TODO Tracking**: Maintain and follow `./.cursor/TODO.md`
- **Update Immediately**: Mark tasks complete as soon as done
- **Subtasks**: Create `TODO_<name>.md` for complex features

## Documentation Standards

- **Single Source of Truth**: Keep important info in `.cursor/rules/`
- **DRY Principle**: Reference other files instead of duplicating
- **Update After Changes**: Refresh docs when architecture changes

## Tool Behavior

- **Cursor Issues**: If editing fails, ask user to restart Cursor
- **Terminal**: Use PowerShell 7, prefer non-interactive commands
