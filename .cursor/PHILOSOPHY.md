# Project Philosophy

Guiding principles for developing and maintaining this project.

---

- **Speed over perfection** — Quick iterations are better than analysis paralysis.
- **Document intent, not just code** — Comments and documentation should explain *why*, not just *what*.
- **Minimalism over bloat** — Only add dependencies, features, and complexity when absolutely needed.
- **Junior-friendly mindset** — Code, commits, and documentation should be understandable by new developers.
- **Learn from failure** — It's okay to make mistakes, but important to document and learn from them.
- **Consistency beats cleverness** — Code should be predictable, even at the cost of less "smart" solutions.
