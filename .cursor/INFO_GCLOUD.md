# Integrating Google APIs and AI into Your Chrome Extension

This guide provides instructions on integrating Google APIs (specifically Currency API and Gemini 2.5) and AI-powered features into your Chrome extension. It also covers setting up a local LLM agent to assist with development.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Chrome Extension

### 1.  Manifest File (`manifest.json`)

   The `manifest.json` file is crucial for defining your extension's capabilities and permissions. Here's a basic example:


[1]  Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more 

Key points:

manifest_version : Use version 3.
permissions :
identity : Required for using Google's OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
storage and unlimitedStorage : To store data locally (e.g., user preferences, API responses).
https://www.googleapis.com/* : Grants access to all Google APIs. Restrict this to specific API endpoints for better security.
background : Specifies the background script ( background.js ) for handling events and API calls.
action : Defines the popup UI ( popup.html ).
oauth2 : Configuration for Google OAuth 2.0:
client_id : Your Google Cloud project's client ID. You'll need to create this in the Google Cloud Console.
scopes : The Google API scopes your extension needs. For basic user info, include the ones shown. Add specific scopes for the Currency API and Gemini API when you use them.
2. Background Script ( background.js )
The background script handles authentication, API calls, and message passing.

// background.js
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Extension installed");
});

// Authentication function
async function getAuthToken() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    chrome.identity.getAuthToken({ interactive: true }, function (token) {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {

Explanation:

getAuthToken() : Retrieves the OAuth 2.0 token. interactive: true prompts the user to log in if they aren't already.
callGoogleAPI() : Generic function to make authenticated API calls. Replace apiEndpoint with the specific API endpoint you want to use.
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener() : Listens for messages from other parts of the extension (popup or content scripts). This is how you'll trigger API calls from the UI.
Example of usage of other functions to get currency rate or to do a Gemini call.
3. Popup UI ( popup.html and popup.js )
Create a simple popup to interact with the user.

popup.html :

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Extension Popup</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Currency Converter</h1>
  <input type="text" id="amount" placeholder="Amount">
  <select id="fromCurrency">
    <option value="USD">USD</option>

Generated code may be subject to license restrictions not shown here. Use code with care. Learn more 

popup.js :

// popup.js
document.getElementById("convertButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const amount = document.getElementById("amount").value;
  const fromCurrency = document.getElementById("fromCurrency").value;
  const toCurrency = document.getElementById("toCurrency").value;

  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(
    { action: "getCurrencyRate", fromCurrency: fromCurrency, toCurrency: toCurrency },
    (response) => {
      if (response && response.rate) {

Explanation:

Simple HTML form for currency conversion and Gemini interaction.
Event listeners for the "Convert" and "Send to Gemini" buttons.
chrome.runtime.sendMessage() : Sends messages to the background script to trigger API calls.
Part 2: Integrating Google APIs 1. Currency API (Example with ExchangeRate-API)
Since there isn't an official "Google Currency API," you'll need to use a third-party currency conversion API. A popular option is ExchangeRate-API.

a. Sign Up and Get an API Key:

Go to a currency exchange rate API provider like ExchangeRate-API and sign up for an account to get your API key.
b. Implement Currency Conversion in background.js :

// background.js
const EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY = "YOUR_EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY";

async function getCurrencyRate(fromCurrency, toCurrency) {
  const url = `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/${EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY}/pair/${fromCurrency}/${toCurrency}`;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const data = await response.json();

2. Gemini 2.5 Integration
To use Gemini 2.5, you'll interact with the Gemini API.

a. Set up Google AI Studio:

Go to Google AI Studio and create a project.
Enable the Gemini API.
Generate an API key.
b. Implement Gemini API Call in background.js :

// background.js
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";

async function callGeminiAPI(prompt) {
  const url = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest:generateContent?key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}`;

  const data = {
    contents: [{
      parts: [{ text: prompt }]
    }]

Important Considerations for Gemini:

API Key Security: Never hardcode your API key directly into the client-side code. Use a secure method to store and retrieve it (e.g., Chrome storage, server-side proxy).
Rate Limits: Be mindful of the Gemini API rate limits. Implement error handling and potentially queue requests to avoid exceeding the limits.
Prompt Engineering: The quality of the results from Gemini depends heavily on the prompt. Experiment with different prompts to achieve the desired outcome.
Part 3: AI Features - Vector Databases
To enhance your extension with AI, you can integrate a vector database for tasks like semantic search, recommendations, or content summarization.

1. Choose a Vector Database
Several options are available:

Pinecone: A popular managed vector database.
Weaviate: An open-source, cloud-native vector search engine.
Qdrant: Another open-source vector search engine.
Chroma: An open-source embedding database.
This example will use Chroma.

2. Set up ChromaDB
pip install chromadb

3. Implement Vector Database Integration (Conceptual Example)
This example assumes you have a function to embed text using an embedding model (like those from TensorFlow Hub or SentenceTransformers).

// Conceptual example (adapt to your chosen vector database)
import chromadb from 'chromadb';

const client = new chromadb.Client();

async function initializeVectorDatabase() {
    // Create a collection
    const collection = await client.createCollection({ name: "my_extension_data" });
}

4. Server-Side Implementation
Keep the vector database and related logic server-side to protect your API keys and ensure security.

a. Create API Endpoints
Create API endpoints for indexing, querying, and managing the vector database.
b. Authentication
Secure your API endpoints with proper authentication (API keys, JWTs).

Part 4: Local LLM Agent (Cursor)
You can use a local LLM agent like Cursor to help with code generation, debugging, and understanding the codebase.

1. Install Cursor or a Similar IDE 2. Provide Context to Your Agent
Paste this Markdown file into a document or project that Cursor can access.

3. Use Cursor for:
Code Completion: Generate code snippets based on your comments and function names.
Debugging: Ask Cursor to help you identify and fix errors in your code.
Explanation: Have Cursor explain complex code sections or API documentation.
Refactoring: Get suggestions on how to improve the structure and readability of your code.
Part 5: Testing and Debugging
Load Unpacked Extension:
Go to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser.
Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
Click "Load unpacked" and select your extension's directory.
Test the Extension:
Open the extension's popup.
Test the currency conversion and Gemini integration.
Check the background script console for errors ( chrome://extensions/ -> "Inspect views background page").
Debugging:
Use console.log() statements to track the flow of execution and variable values.
Use the Chrome DevTools debugger to step through your code and inspect variables.
Part 6: Security Considerations
API Key Security: Never expose your API keys directly in your client-side code. Use a server-side proxy or Chrome storage with encryption to protect them.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Set a strict CSP in your manifest.json to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
Permissions: Request only the necessary permissions in your manifest.json .
Regular Updates: Keep your extension and dependencies up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.
Part 7: Monetization
If you want to monetize your Chrome extension, here are a few options:

ExtensionPay: It supports monthly, quarterly, yearly, and one-time payments; free trials; multi-browser and multi-device login.
In-App Purchases: Integrate with a payment gateway like Stripe to offer premium features or subscriptions.
Freemium Model: Offer a basic version of your extension for free and charge for advanced features.
Conclusion
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of integrating Google APIs and AI features into your Chrome extension. Remember to adapt the code examples to your specific needs and follow security best practices to protect your users and your API keys.

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **More Specific Permissions:** Instead of `https://www.googleapis.com/*`, try to narrow down the permissions to the specific API endpoints you'll be using.  This enhances security.
*   **Error Handling:**  The code includes basic error handling for API calls.  Implement more robust error handling in a production environment.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Be *very* aware of the rate limits for the Currency API and Gemini API.  Implement strategies to avoid
