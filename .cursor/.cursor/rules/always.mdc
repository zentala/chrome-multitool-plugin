# Always

## General

- **Work in YOLO mode:**  
  Trust your judgment. I have aligned with you on this — **DO NOT ask for permission**.  
  If unsure, follow tasks from `./.cursor/TODO.md`.

- **Context awareness:**  
  Always refer to `./.cursor/CURSOR.md` for project overview and context.  
  Update it when significant decisions are made.

- **Task tracking:**  
  - Maintain and follow `./.cursor/TODO.md`.
  - Use `[ ]` for open tasks and `[x]` for completed ones.
  - Refactor old TODOs to this checkbox format.
  - Update TODOs immediately after completing changes.

## Commits

- Commit **after every completed task**.
- Test code before committing.
  - `pnpm run test >> test.log`
  - then fix them all, then commit
- Use **Conventional Commits** format.
- Always `git status` before commit and **try to commit all relevant changes** together.
- sometimes ammend commit if it makes more sense

## Terminal

- Use **PowerShell 7** (`pwsh`) on **Windows 11**.
- Use **pnpm** as the package manager.
- Prefer **non-interactive mode** for commands when possible.
- Never use ` | cat` becasuse not works!

## Code and Documentation Style

- Write **junior-friendly code and documentation**:
  - Use **JSDoc comments** on exported functions, classes, complex logic.
  - Add **TODO** and **FIXME** in code to mark future improvements or known issues.
  - If file is longer than 200 lines split it into smaler files
  - on top of every ts/tsx file comment what is purpose of this file in the app context
  - If fixing a problem:
    - Document **which approaches were tried and failed**.

- Maintain folder cleanliness:
  - After major changes, **remove or archive outdated files**.
  - Update `./.cursor/TODO.md` plans or `./.cursor/ARCH.md` if structure changed & search here for info


## Testing

- Tests don't have to cover everything initially.
- If skipping a hard-to-test part:
  - Leave a **comment** explaining what was skipped and why.
  - Add `TODO` or `FIXME` for future improvement.
- Prioritize testing core logic over minor UI behaviors unless critical.

## Cursor and Tools Behavior

- If you experience editing issues with tools (file won't update few times):
  - Pause work immediately and **ask the user to restart Cursor**.
  - After restart, continue work.

# ✨ Notes for Better Context Maintenance

- Regularly refresh all files under `.cursor/`.
- Enforce Stale Checks to ensure documentation, diagrams, and TODOs are up-to-date.
- Document what didn't work, not only what did — build context over time.
